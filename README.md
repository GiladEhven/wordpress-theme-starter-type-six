# WordPress Theme Starter Type Six

### wordpress-theme-starter-type-six

I make and maintain projects like this one for my own use. It's public because I like to share and I'm happy to accept feedback and criticism. And because it's the thing to do these days. However, this project really is about making my work a little easier, so if some of my decisions seem a little weird to you, do please keep in mind that I am not currently operating under any mandate to comply with common or official standards. Like I said, this is for me. And for you, if you like.
